    <p><strong>Usability</strong> and the utility, not the visual design, determine the success or failure of a web-site. Since the visitor of the page is the only person who clicks the mouse and therefore decides everything, user-centric design has become a standard approach for successful and profit-oriented web design. After all, if users can't use a feature, it might as well not exist. </p>

    <p>We aren't going to discuss the implementation details (e.g. where the search box should be placed) as it has already been done in a number of articles; instead we focus on the <strong>main principles, heuristics and approaches for effective web design</strong> - approaches which, used properly, can lead to more sophisticated design decisions and simplify the process of perceiving presented information.</p>

    <h2>Principles Of Effective Web Design Link</h2>
    <p>In order to use the principles properly we first need to understand how users interact with websites, how they think and what are the basic patterns of users' behavior.</p>

    <h2>How do users think?</h2>
    <p>Basically, users' habits on the Web aren't that different from customers' habits in a store. Visitors glance at each new page, scan some of the text, and click on the first link that catches their interest or vaguely resembles the thing they're looking for. In fact, there are large parts of the page they don't even look at.</p>
    <p>Most users search for something interesting (or useful) and clickable; as soon as some promising candidates are found, users click. If the new page doesn't meet users' expectations, the Back button is clicked and the search process is continued.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Users appreciate quality and credibility.</li>
        <li>Users don't read, they scan. </li>
        <li>Web users are impatient and insist on instant gratification.</li>
        <li>Users don't make optimal choices. </li>
        <li>Users follow their intuition. </li>
        <li>Users want to have control. </li>
    </ul>

    <div id="accordion">
    <!-- BEGIN ACCORDION -->
        <h3><i class="fa fa-camera" aria-hidden="true"></i> 1. Don't make users think</h3>
        <div>
            <p>According to Krug's first law of usability, the web-page should beobvious and self-explanatory. When you're creating a site, your job is to get rid of the question marks - the decisions users need to make consciously, considering pros, cons and alternatives.
            If the navigation and site architecture aren't intuitive, the number of question marks grows and makes it harder for users to comprehend how the system works and how to get from point A to point B. A clear structure, moderate visual clues and easily recognizable links can help users to find their path to their aim.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>2. Don't squander users' patience</h3>
        <div>
            <p>In every project when you are going to offer your visitors some service or tool, try to keep your user requirements minimal. The less action is required from users to test a service, the more likely a random visitor is to actually try it out.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>3. Manage to focus users' attention</h3>
        <div>
            <p>As web-sites provide both static and dynamic content, some aspects of the user interface attract attention more than others do. Obviously, images are more eye-catching than the text - just as the sentences marked as bold are more attractive than plain text.</p>
        
            <p>The human eye is a highly non-linear device, and web-users can instantly recognize edges, patterns and motions. This is why video-based advertisements are extremely annoying and distracting, but from the marketing perspective they perfectly do the job of capturing users' attention.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>4. Strive for feature exposure</h3>
    <div><p>Modern web designs are usually criticized due to their approach of guiding users with visually appealing 1-2-3-done-steps, large buttons with visual effects etc. But from the design perspective these elements actually aren't a bad thing. On the contrary, such guidelines are extremely effective as they lead the visitors through the site content in a very simple and user-friendly way.</p>
    
        <p>Letting the user see clearly what functions are available is a fundamental principle of successful user interface design. It doesn't really matter how this is achieved. What matters is that the content is well-understood and visitors feel comfortable with the way they interact with the system.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>5. Make use of effective writing</h3>
    <div><p>As the Web is different from print, it's necessary to adjust the writing style to users' preferences and browsing habits. Promotional writing won't be read. Long text blocks without images and keywords marked inbold or italics will be skipped. Exaggerated language will be ignored.</p></div>

    <h3>6. Strive for simplicity</h3>
    <div><p>The "keep it simple"-principle (KIS) should be the primary goal of site design. Users are rarely on a site to enjoy the design; furthermore, in most cases they are looking for the information despite the design. Strive for simplicity instead of complexity.</p>
    
        <p>From the visitors' point of view, the best site design is a pure text, without any advertisements or further content blocks matching exactly the query visitors used or the content they've been looking for. This is one of the reasons why a user-friendly print-version of web pages is essential for good user experience.</p></div>

    <h3>7. Don't be afraid of the white space</h3>
    <div><p>Actually it's really hard to overestimate the importance of white space. Not only does it help to reduce the cognitive load for the visitors, but it makes it possible to perceive the information presented on the screen. When a new visitor approaches a design layout, the first thing he/she tries to do is to scan the page and divide the content area into digestible pieces of information. </p>
    
        <p>Complex structures are harder to read, scan, analyze and work with. If you have the choice between separating two design segments by a visible line or by some whitespace, it's usually better to use the whitespace solution. Hierarchical structures reduce complexity(Simon's Law): the better you manage to provide users with a sense of visual hierarchy, the easier your content will be to perceive. </p>
    
        <p>White space is good. <a href="http://cameron.io" target="_new">Cameron.io</a> uses white space as a primary design element. The result is a well-scannable layout which gives the content a dominating position it deserves.</p></div>


    <h3>8. Communicate effectively with a "visible language"</h3>
    <div><p>In his papers on effective visual communication, Aaron Marcus statesthree fundamental principles involved in the use of the so-called "visible language" - the content users see on a screen. </p>
    
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organize:</strong> rovide the user with a clear and consistent conceptual structure. Consistency, screen layout, relationships and navigability are important concepts of organization. The same conventions and rules should be applied to all elements.</li>
                <li><strong>Economize:</strong> do the most with the least amount of cues and visual elements. Four major points to be considered: simplicity, clarity, distinctiveness, and emphasis. Simplicity includes only the elements that are most important for communication. Clarity: all components should be designed so their meaning is not ambiguous. Distinctiveness: the important properties of the necessary elements should be distinguishable. Emphasis: the most important elements should be easily perceived.</li>
                <li><strong>Communicate:</strong> match the presentation to the capabilities of the user. The user interface must keep in balance legibility, readability, typography, symbolism, multiple views, and color or texture in order to communicate successfully. Use max. 3 typefaces in a maximum of 3 point sizes - a maximum of 18 words or 50-80 characters per line of text.</li>
            </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>9. Conventions are our friends</h3>
    <div><p>Conventional design of site elements doesn't result in a boring web site. In fact, conventions are very useful as they reduce the learning curve, the need to figure out how things work. For instance, it would be a usability nightmare if all web-sites had different visual presentation of RSS-feeds. That's not that different from our regular life where we tend to get used to basic principles of how we organize data (folders) or do shopping (placement of products).</p>
    
        <p>With conventions you can gain users' confidence, trust, reliability and prove your credibility. Follow users' expectations - understand what they're expecting from a site navigation, text structure, search placement etc.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>10. Test early, test often</h3>
    <div><p>This so-called TETO-principle should be applied to every web design project as usability tests often provide crucial insights into significant problems and issues related to a given layout.</p>
        <p>Test not too late, not too little and not for the wrong reasons. In the latter case it's necessary to understand that most design decisions are local; that means that you can't universally answer whether some layout is better than the other one as you need to analyze it from a very specific point of view (considering requirements, stakeholders, budget etc.).</p>
